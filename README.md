# GraphCodeBERT for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

## Project Overview

This notebook implements a deep learning system for detecting vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts using **GraphCodeBERT**, a pre-trained transformer model specialized for code understanding. The system classifies contracts across 6 vulnerability types:

- **Access Control** - Unauthorized function access
- **Arithmetic** - Integer overflow/underflow  
- **Reentrancy** - Recursive call exploitation
- **Unchecked Calls** - Missing return value checks
- **Other** - Additional vulnerability patterns
- **Safe** - No vulnerabilities detected

---

## Why GraphCodeBERT?

### The Architecture Decision

**GraphCodeBERT is an encoder-only transformer**, similar to BERT but pre-trained on 6 million code samples. Here's why this architecture is perfect for vulnerability detection:

```
Task: Vulnerability Classification
Input:  Solidity smart contract (code)
Output: Vulnerability labels [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Architecture needed: UNDERSTANDING, not GENERATION
Answer: Encoder-only ✅
```

### Encoder-Only vs Other Architectures

| Architecture | Type | Use Case | Example | Our Task? |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Encoder-Only** | Understanding | Classification, Detection | BERT, GraphCodeBERT | YES |
| **Decoder-Only** | Generation | Autocomplete, Chat | GPT, Copilot | No (we don't generate code) |
| **Encoder-Decoder** | Transformation | Bug Repair, Translation | T5, CodeT5 | No (we classify, not fix) |

**Key Concept:**
- **Encoder-only** models are **non-autoregressive** - they process all tokens in parallel and see the entire contract context bidirectionally
- **Decoder-only** models are **autoregressive** - they generate one token at a time, only seeing previous tokens (left-to-right)
- For understanding/classification tasks like ours, non-autoregressive encoders are faster and more effective

## The Hierarchical Chunking Solution

### The Problem

Standard BERT-style models have a **512-token limit**, but:
- Average Solidity contract: ~18,600 characters ≈ **4,500 tokens**
- Truncating to 512 tokens = seeing only **11% of the contract**
- Early experiments with truncation: **0.35 F1** (terrible!)

### The Solution: Hierarchical Chunking

```
Contract (4,500 tokens)
  ↓
Split into overlapping chunks
  ├─ Chunk 1:  tokens [0-512]     
  ├─ Chunk 2:  tokens [462-974]   ← 50 token overlap
  ├─ Chunk 3:  tokens [924-1436]
  ├─ ...
  └─ Chunk 10: tokens [4138-4500]
  ↓
Process each chunk through GraphCodeBERT
  ├─ Chunk 1 → [768-dim embedding]
  ├─ Chunk 2 → [768-dim embedding]
  └─ ...
  ↓
Aggregate chunks via mean pooling
  → Contract embedding [768-dim]
  ↓
Classification layer
  → [access-control: 0.9, arithmetic: 0.1, ...]
```

**Result:**
- **100% contract coverage** (vs 11% with truncation)
- **Expected F1: 0.85-0.88** (vs 0.35 with truncation)
- **2.5x improvement** from proper architecture design

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Tokenization & Chunking

```python
Tokenizer: RobertaTokenizer (Byte-Pair Encoding)
  • Vocabulary: 50,265 tokens
  • Handles any Unicode character (no [UNK] tokens)
  • Byte-level encoding ensures Solidity syntax coverage

Chunking Strategy:
  • Chunk size: 512 tokens (model's native limit)
  • Overlap: 50 tokens (preserves context across boundaries)
  • Stride: 462 tokens (512 - 50)
  • Result: ~40 chunks per contract
```

### 2. Embedding Generation

**Three-Level Aggregation:**

```
LEVEL 1: Token-Level (Initial)
  512 tokens × 768 dimensions per chunk
  ↓
LEVEL 2: Chunk-Level (First Aggregation)
  Extract [CLS] token from each chunk → 1 × 768 per chunk
  ↓
LEVEL 3: Contract-Level (Second Aggregation)  
  Mean pooling across all chunks → 1 × 768 per contract
```

**Why [CLS] Token?**
- BERT-style models train the [CLS] (classification) token to represent the entire sequence
- It's a learned aggregation (smarter than simple averaging)
- Standard practice for transformer-based classification

**Why Mean Pooling for Contracts?**
- Equal weight to all chunks (democratic)
- Prevents single chunk from dominating
- Simple, stable, effective

### 3. Classifier Architecture

```python
Frozen GraphCodeBERT (125M params)
  ↓
Contract Embedding [768-dim]
  ↓
Classifier (trainable, 200K params):
  Linear(768 → 256) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  Linear(256 → 128) + ReLU + Dropout(0.3)
  Linear(128 → 6)
  ↓
Vulnerability Scores [6 classes]
```

## Frozen vs Fine-Tuning: Why We Don't Fine-Tune

### The Data-to-Parameter Ratio Problem

```
Our Dataset: 15,000 training contracts

Option 1 - Frozen GraphCodeBERT (our choice):
  Trainable: 200K params (classifier only)
  Ratio: 15,000 samples ÷ 0.2M params = 75 samples/M param 
  
Option 2 - Fine-tune Last 2 Layers:
  Trainable: 12M params
  Ratio: 15,000 samples ÷ 12M params = 1.25 samples/M param 
  
Option 3 - Full Fine-tuning:
  Trainable: 125M params
  Ratio: 15,000 samples ÷ 125M params = 0.12 samples/M param 

Rule of Thumb: Need 1,000+ samples per million parameters
```

### Experimental Evidence

The fine-tuning analysis notebook demonstrates:

| Configuration | Trainable Params | Val F1 | Train-Val Gap | Status |
|--------------|------------------|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Frozen** | 0.2M | **0.85** | -0.03 | Healthy |
| Last 2 Layers | 12M | 0.83 | -0.10 | Slight overfit |
| Last 6 Layers | 50M | 0.78 | -0.22 | Overfitting |
| Full Fine-tune | 125M | 0.72 | -0.35 | Severe overfit |

**Key Insight:** With limited data, fine-tuning destroys the valuable pre-trained knowledge. The learning rate must be so low to avoid overfitting that updates become meaningless—making fine-tuning counterproductive.

## Hyperparameter Exploration

We systematically tested variations to optimize performance:

### 1. Chunk Overlap
```
Tested: [0, 25, 50, 100] tokens
Finding: 50 tokens provides optimal balance
  • 0 tokens: Faster but misses cross-boundary context
  • 100 tokens: Slower with diminishing returns
```

### 2. Aggregation Methods
```
Tested: Mean pooling, Max pooling, Attention pooling
Finding: Attention pooling slightly better (+2% F1)
  • Learns to weight important code sections
  • More complex but worthwhile improvement
```

### 3. Classifier Architecture
```
Tested: 
  • Baseline: [768 → 256 → 128 → 6]
  • Deeper: [768 → 512 → 256 → 128 → 6]
  • Wider: [768 → 512 → 512 → 6]
  • BatchNorm: Adding normalization layers
  
Finding: Baseline performs best (simpler is better with limited data)
```

## Key ML Concepts Explained

### Autoregressive vs Non-Autoregressive

**Autoregressive (AR)** - Sequential generation, one token at a time
```
Example: GPT generating code
  "function" → "calculate" → "Interest" → "(" → ...
  Each token depends on all previous tokens
  Use: Code generation, autocomplete, chatbots
```

**Non-Autoregressive (NAR)** - Parallel processing, all tokens at once
```
Example: GraphCodeBERT understanding code
  Sees entire contract simultaneously
  All tokens attend to each other (bidirectional)
  Use: Classification, understanding, detection ← Our task!
```

**Why NAR for Our Task:**
- ✅ Need to see full contract context (vulnerabilities can be anywhere)
- ✅ Faster inference (parallel vs sequential)
- ✅ Bidirectional attention captures complex patterns
- ❌ Cannot generate code (but we don't need to!)

### Transfer Learning Strategy

**Transfer Learning** = Using knowledge from one task (pre-training) for another task (our vulnerability detection)

```
Pre-training (Anthropic/Microsoft):
  • 6 million code samples (Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, PHP)
  • 125M parameters learn code syntax, patterns, semantics
  • Weeks of training on massive GPU clusters

Our Task (Transfer Learning):
  • Freeze pre-trained weights (preserve learned knowledge)
  • Train small classifier on 15K Solidity contracts
  • Hours of training on single GPU
  • Leverage code understanding, adapt to vulnerabilities
```

**Why This Works:**
- Code patterns are universal (loops, functions, conditionals)
- Vulnerability patterns use common code structures
- Don't need to re-learn basic code understanding
- Small dataset is sufficient for task-specific classifier

## Design Decisions & Justifications

### 1. Why GraphCodeBERT over other models?

**Alternatives Considered:**

- **CodeBERT:** Similar but lacks graph-aware capabilities
- **BERT/DistilBERT:** Not pre-trained on code
- **CodeT5:** Encoder-decoder is overkill (we don't generate code)
- **GPT-based models:** Unidirectional, can't look backward efficiently

**GraphCodeBERT Advantages:**
- ✅ Pre-trained on 6M+ code samples
- ✅ Academic standard (CodeXGLUE benchmark)
- ✅ Bidirectional understanding
- ✅ Future option: Use graph features (DFG/CFG)

### 2. Why Hierarchical Chunking?

**Alternative: Extract Control/Data Flow Graphs**

```
CFG/DFG Extraction:
  Pros: Structural information, explicit relationships
  Cons: 
    ❌ 12-15 hours processing time
    ❌ 10-15% failure rate on complex contracts
    ❌ Requires Solidity compiler
    ❌ Poor ROI for marginal gains

Hierarchical Chunking:
  Pros:
    ✅ 100% success rate
    ✅ 1 hour processing time
    ✅ Full contract coverage
    ✅ Simple, reliable implementation
  Cons: No explicit structural info (but embeddings capture it)
```

### 3. Why Freeze Pre-trained Weights?

See **Frozen vs Fine-Tuning** section above. TL;DR:
- ✅ Prevents overfitting on small dataset
- ✅ Preserves valuable pre-trained knowledge
- ✅ Faster training (fewer parameters)
- ✅ Better generalization

## Future Extensions

### 1. Multi-Branch Fusion Architecture

Combine three complementary approaches:

```
Branch 1: Tree Models (Random Forest)
  • Hand-crafted features (50-dim)
  • Explicit patterns (has_owner, delegatecall_count)
  • F1: 0.90

Branch 2: GraphCodeBERT (This Work)
  • Learned semantic embeddings (768-dim)
  • Code understanding from pre-training
  • F1: 0.85-0.88

Branch 3: Graph Neural Network
  • Function call graph structure
  • Architectural patterns
  • F1: 0.70-0.75

Fusion Layer (Attention-weighted):
  • Combines all three branches
  • Expected F1: 0.92-0.94
```

### 2. Vulnerability Repair System

Add encoder-decoder model for automatic fixing:

```
Stage 1: Detection (GraphCodeBERT - Current)
  Input: Vulnerable contract
  Output: "Reentrancy detected at line 45"

Stage 2: Repair (CodeT5 - Future)
  Input: Vulnerable contract + detection
  Output: Fixed contract with explanation
```

### 3. Graph Features Integration

Use GraphCodeBERT's graph-aware capabilities:

```
Current: Text-only mode
Future: Text + Control Flow Graph + Data Flow Graph
  • Explicit state transitions
  • Variable dependencies
  • Call relationships
```
